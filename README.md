# Eyes Assignment
## Directions: To create a code that included two eyes that follow the cursor of the user on the page.


### Description:
-This project uses functions as well as acessing the DOM objects in order to create the appearance of two eyes following the viewers cursor.

-I have changed the background color to a nude color in order to make it more realistic and have added another eye on the page so it was not only one.

### How to run: 
1. Fork repository
2. Clone repo
3. Drag the eyes.html file onto your browser.
4. Move cursor around the page to see the eye balls follow your every move.


### Future Improvements
-In the future I would like to debug and fix the code I have commented out that was meant to make the an colored iris around each eye ball.
-I would also like to code other facial features to make the eyes lie on a complete face.
